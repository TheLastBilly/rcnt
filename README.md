# rcnt
`rcnt` is a small python utility that counts the rotations of a rocket based on a video file shooted from a camara located on it's side during launch. Currently `rcnt` works by calculating the overall "brightness" of the video, so it works best when the rocket is launched during the day.

## Requierements
* Git
* Python3
* Pip
* OpenCv (opencv-python)

## Usage
First, clone this repository

`git clone https://github.com/TheLastBilly/rcnt`

Second, run `rcnt` ;)

`python3 rcnt [video_file_path]`
